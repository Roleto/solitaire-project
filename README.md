This is my implementation for a tic-tac-toe board game.

This is my first try writing an installation guide (so I hope it's going to be okay :) )
First, download the project from the git hub then extract it somewhere on your computer or clone the repository.
Then open cmd in the project directory.
Then write the next command: npm i.
Then it is done and you can write npm run dev and open the webpage
