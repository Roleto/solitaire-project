This is my implementation for a solitaire board game.

This is my first try writing an installation guide (so I hope it's going to be okay :) )
  first, download the project from the git hub then extract it somewhere on your computer or clone the repository
  then open cmd in the project directory
  then write the next command: npm i
  then it is done and you can write npm run dev and open the webpage
